## Week Five Challenge: Basic Bullhorn
You are to write an application that is kind of like Twitter. It will allow a user to
post a message, and everyone else to see all the messages that have been posted. 

Users can edit and delete their own messages. 

Build an application that allows you to add MESSAGEs, list them and view them.

**Message object should have at least:**
- id
- title
- content
- postedDate
- postedBy

**Features/Functionalities:**
- The home page ("/") path should point to a list of all MESSAGE's
- Every page (or template) should have link (or button) to the add path 
("/add") which is the new MESSAGE form
- Use a repository to store your messages
- The user should be able to update, view single messages on their own page, and delete messages.
- Add Bootstrap and styling to make your pages look professional.
- Once your application is working, put it on GitHub and deploy to Heroku.
- Submit your Heroku link (you can add the GitHub link as a comment).
